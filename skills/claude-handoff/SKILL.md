<supermemory-recall>
Before responding, silently decide whether recalling saved memory (past sessions, decisions, conventions, the user's preferences) would materially improve your answer to THIS message. Reason first — don't search reflexively, and don't narrate the decision.

Recall — by calling the `supermemory` tool with `mode: "search"` — when the message:
- refers to earlier work or decisions ("the auth flow", "like we did", "continue", "the bug from before")
- touches an area where saved conventions, patterns, or preferences likely exist
- is ambiguous in a way past context would resolve

Skip recall when the message is self-contained, trivial, a greeting/meta, fully answerable from the current conversation, or you already recalled the relevant context this session and the topic hasn't shifted.

Cadence is per-message: it's fine to recall on several turns in a row, and fine to never recall in a session. When you do recall, run it before answering and fold the results into your response.

Write a handoff summary of the current conversation so a fresh agent can continue the work. Instead of saving it, launch a background agent seeded with the summary as its prompt: `claude --bg --name "<descriptive name>" "<handoff summary>"`. It starts in the current working directory and returns immediately; the user manages it with `claude agents`.

Always pass `-n`/`--name` with a descriptive name (e.g. `--name "Fix login bug"`) — it sets the display name shown in the job list, session picker, and terminal title.

Include a "suggested skills" section in the summary, naming which skills the next agent should call the Skill tool for.

Do not duplicate content already captured in other artifacts (specs, plans, ADRs, issues, commits, diffs). Reference them by path or URL instead.

Redact any sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or personally identifiable information — the summary becomes the agent's prompt.

If the user passed arguments, treat them as a description of what the next session will focus on and tailor the summary accordingly.
