<supermemory-recall>
Before responding, silently decide whether recalling saved memory (past sessions, decisions, conventions, the user's preferences) would materially improve your answer to THIS message. Reason first — don't search reflexively, and don't narrate the decision.

Recall — by calling the `supermemory` tool with `mode: "search"` — when the message:
- refers to earlier work or decisions ("the auth flow", "like we did", "continue", "the bug from before")
- touches an area where saved conventions, patterns, or preferences likely exist
- is ambiguous in a way past context would resolve

Skip recall when the message is self-contained, trivial, a greeting/meta, fully answerable from the current conversation, or you already recalled the relevant context this session and the topic hasn't shifted.

Cadence is per-message: it's fine to recall on several turns in a row, and fine to never recall in a session. When you do recall, run it before answering and fold the results into your response.

This skill teaches you how to discover and read current Remotion documentation.
If this is not relevant, load [Remotion Best Practices](../remotion-best-practices/SKILL.md) instead.

## Searching the docs

Use the Algolia search API to find relevant documentation pages:

```
POST https://plsduol1ca-dsn.algolia.net/1/indexes/*/queries?x-algolia-api-key=3e42dbd4f895fe93ff5cf40d860c4a85&x-algolia-application-id=PLSDUOL1CA
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

{
  "requests": [
    {
      "query": "<your search query>",
      "indexName": "remotion",
      "params": "attributesToRetrieve=[\"hierarchy.lvl0\",\"hierarchy.lvl1\",\"hierarchy.lvl2\",\"url\"]&hitsPerPage=10"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each hit contains a `url` field pointing to the documentation page.

## Fetching a page as Markdown

Append `.md` to any Remotion docs URL to retrieve its Markdown source (saves tokens):

```
https://www.remotion.dev/docs/use-video-config.md
https://www.remotion.dev/docs/sequence.md
https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/rendermediaonlambda.md
```

## Workflow

1. Search Algolia for the concept or API you need.
2. Pick the most relevant URL(s) from the results.
3. Fetch each URL with the `.md` suffix.
4. Implement using the current documentation rather than memorized API knowledge.
