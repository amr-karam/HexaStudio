<supermemory-recall>
Before responding, silently decide whether recalling saved memory (past sessions, decisions, conventions, the user's preferences) would materially improve your answer to THIS message. Reason first — don't search reflexively, and don't narrate the decision.

Recall — by calling the `supermemory` tool with `mode: "search"` — when the message:
- refers to earlier work or decisions ("the auth flow", "like we did", "continue", "the bug from before")
- touches an area where saved conventions, patterns, or preferences likely exist
- is ambiguous in a way past context would resolve

Skip recall when the message is self-contained, trivial, a greeting/meta, fully answerable from the current conversation, or you already recalled the relevant context this session and the topic hasn't shifted.

Cadence is per-message: it's fine to recall on several turns in a row, and fine to never recall in a session. When you do recall, run it before answering and fold the results into your response.

# Upgrade Remotion

1. Inspect the project manifests and lockfile to identify the package manager and workspaces. Preserve unrelated changes.
2. Determine whether `@remotion/cli` is locally available. If it is, run:

   ```bash
   npx remotion upgrade
   ```

   This also updates project-local Remotion skills. Skip the manual upgrade below.

3. If `@remotion/cli` is not available, upgrade manually:
   - Get the latest stable Remotion version with `npm view remotion version`.
   - Find every installed `remotion` and `@remotion/*` dependency across the project and upgrade them all to that exact version. Preserve their dependency sections and the project's workspace or catalog conventions.
   - Read the current [Mediabunny compatibility page](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/mediabunny/version) and determine the Mediabunny version compatible with the target Remotion version. Upgrade every installed `mediabunny` and `@mediabunny/*` package to the documented compatible version.
   - Run the project's package manager to update its lockfile.
4. If `@remotion/cli` is not available, update the installed Remotion skills:

   ```bash
   npx skills update remotion-best-practices remotion-captions remotion-create remotion-docs remotion-interactivity remotion-maps remotion-markup remotion-multimedia remotion-render remotion-saas remotion-studio remotion-upgrade --yes
   ```

5. Review the manifest and lockfile diff. Ensure all Remotion packages use one version and all installed Mediabunny packages use the compatible version. If the CLI is available, run `npx remotion versions` as an additional check.

The [Remotion releases](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/releases) contain the changelog and may be useful for summarizing relevant changes after the upgrade.
