  Ensures proper Python dependency management, avoiding global `pip install` and
  adhering to project-specific tooling.

  Use this skill if any of the following are true:
    1. Attempting to run `pip install {package_name}`.
    2. Python packages or dependencies need to be added or modified.
    3. Initiating a new Python project.
    4. Creating a new notebook, even if just using BigQuery cells.
    5. Generating Python code that includes `import` statements for third-party libraries.
    6. Before executing Python scripts via the terminal to ensure the correct virtual environment is active.

<supermemory-recall>
Before responding, silently decide whether recalling saved memory (past sessions, decisions, conventions, the user's preferences) would materially improve your answer to THIS message. Reason first — don't search reflexively, and don't narrate the decision.

Recall — by calling the `supermemory` tool with `mode: "search"` — when the message:
- refers to earlier work or decisions ("the auth flow", "like we did", "continue", "the bug from before")
- touches an area where saved conventions, patterns, or preferences likely exist
- is ambiguous in a way past context would resolve

Skip recall when the message is self-contained, trivial, a greeting/meta, fully answerable from the current conversation, or you already recalled the relevant context this session and the topic hasn't shifted.

Cadence is per-message: it's fine to recall on several turns in a row, and fine to never recall in a session. When you do recall, run it before answering and fold the results into your response.

# Python Dependency Management Rule

> [!CAUTION]
>
> **BEFORE any `pip install`**: You MUST first detect the project's existing
> dependency manager and use it correctly. Do NOT override the project's
> established tooling.

## Dependency Manager Detection

Before installing ANY Python package, check the workspace for these files **in
priority order**:

1.  **Signal:** `uv.lock` or `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.uv]`
    *   **Tool:** **uv**
    *   **Install:** `uv add <package>`
    *   **Setup:** `uv sync`
2.  **Signal:** `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.poetry]`
    *   **Tool:** **Poetry**
    *   **Install:** `poetry add <package>`
    *   **Setup:** `poetry install`
3.  **Signal:** `Pipfile`
    *   **Tool:** **Pipenv**
    *   **Install:** `pipenv install <package>`
    *   **Setup:** `pipenv install`
4.  **Signal:** `environment.yml`
    *   **Tool:** **Conda**
    *   **Install:** `conda install <package>`
    *   **Setup:** `conda env create -f environment.yml`
5.  **Signal:** `requirements.txt` only
    *   **Tool:** **venv + pip**
    *   **Install:** `.venv/bin/pip install <package>`
    *   **Setup:** `.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`
6.  **Signal:** None of the above
    *   **Tool:** **venv + pip** (default)
    *   **Install:** `.venv/bin/pip install <package>`
    *   **Setup:** `.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Default: venv + pip

If no dependency manager is detected, use **venv + pip + requirements.txt** as
the default:

```bash
# Initialize environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Add dependencies
.venv/bin/pip install <package>

# Preserve state
.venv/bin/pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

**Rules for venv + pip workflow:**

-   Always use `.venv/bin/pip` or `.venv/bin/python` (explicit path).
-   After installing, run: `.venv/bin/pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
-   When setting up: `.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Prohibited

-   **NEVER** run `pip install` globally
-   **NEVER** override an existing dependency manager with a different one
