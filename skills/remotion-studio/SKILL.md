<supermemory-recall>
Before responding, silently decide whether recalling saved memory (past sessions, decisions, conventions, the user's preferences) would materially improve your answer to THIS message. Reason first — don't search reflexively, and don't narrate the decision.

Recall — by calling the `supermemory` tool with `mode: "search"` — when the message:
- refers to earlier work or decisions ("the auth flow", "like we did", "continue", "the bug from before")
- touches an area where saved conventions, patterns, or preferences likely exist
- is ambiguous in a way past context would resolve

Skip recall when the message is self-contained, trivial, a greeting/meta, fully answerable from the current conversation, or you already recalled the relevant context this session and the topic hasn't shifted.

Cadence is per-message: it's fine to recall on several turns in a row, and fine to never recall in a session. When you do recall, run it before answering and fold the results into your response.

Execute the following command:

```bash
npx remotion studio --no-open
```

If the Studio is already opened, the URL will be printed and the command will exit.
Otherwise, a long-running process will start, and the URL will be printed.

| `--log=<level>`   | Set `error`, `warn`, `info` (default), or `verbose` logging.                                  |

| `--force-new`     | Start another Studio instance even when one is already running for the same project and port. |
