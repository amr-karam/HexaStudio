<supermemory-recall>
Before responding, silently decide whether recalling saved memory (past sessions, decisions, conventions, the user's preferences) would materially improve your answer to THIS message. Reason first — don't search reflexively, and don't narrate the decision.

Recall — by calling the `supermemory` tool with `mode: "search"` — when the message:
- refers to earlier work or decisions ("the auth flow", "like we did", "continue", "the bug from before")
- touches an area where saved conventions, patterns, or preferences likely exist
- is ambiguous in a way past context would resolve

Skip recall when the message is self-contained, trivial, a greeting/meta, fully answerable from the current conversation, or you already recalled the relevant context this session and the topic hasn't shifted.

Cadence is per-message: it's fine to recall on several turns in a row, and fine to never recall in a session. When you do recall, run it before answering and fold the results into your response.

One can build apps with Remotion.  
It is possible to have a simple form and hook it up to a render, or have a complex video editor.

## Choosing a template or a framework

We have several templates for SaaS which can be cloned or used as a reference.
See [Choosing a framework](framework.md) for help choosing a template or framework.

## The `<Player>`

This component allows embedding a Remotion preview in a React app. See [Player](player.md) for more information about the Player.

## Rendering

There are client-side and server-side rendering options available. See [Rendering](rendering.md) for advice on how to choose, and about the Lambda, Vercel, Node.js and Cloudflare options.
